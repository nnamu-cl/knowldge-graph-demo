There are no entries for romantic partners, favorites, or potential suitors. \n\nIn historical context, while Elizabeth I never married, there were several men who were considered close to her or rumored to have romantic connections with her, most notably:\n\n1. Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester - one of her favorites and a close companion throughout much of her reign\n2. Francis, Duke of Anjou - a French royal who courted her when she was in her 40s\n3. Sir Walter Raleigh - another court favorite\n4. Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex - a later favorite who eventually fell from grace\n\nHowever, none of these relationships are documented in our knowledge graph, and the exact nature of these relationships remains a subject of historical debate. What is clear from both the knowledge graph and historical record is that Elizabeth I never married.\n</thinking>\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n\nElizabeth I never married anyone. Often referred to as the \"Virgin Queen,\" she remained single throughout her life and reign. The knowledge graph confirms this by showing no spouse relationships for her, only familial relationships (daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, sister to Edward VI and Mary I) and political relationships.\n\nWhile not reflected in the knowledge graph, historical records indicate she had several suitors and potential marriage alliances were discussed throughout her reign for political purposes. Her decision to remain unmarried was unusual for monarchs of her time but allowed her to maintain her independence and authority as a female ruler in the 16th century, avoiding having to submit to a husband's authority."

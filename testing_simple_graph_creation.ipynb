Their official marriage was at Saint Isaac\\'s Cathedral in Saint Petersburg on 9 February 1712. On this day, the two children previously born to the couple (Anna and Elizabeth) were legitimised by their father and given the title of Tsarevna (\"princess\") on 6 March 1711. Of the twelve children born to Peter and Catherine (five sons and seven daughters), only the sisters survived to adulthood. They had one older surviving sibling, crown prince Alexei Petrovich, who was Peter\\'s son by his first wife, noblewoman Eudoxia Lopukhina.\\nAs a child, Elizabeth was the favourite of her father, whom she resembled both physically and temperamentally. Even though he adored his daughter, Peter did not devote time or attention to her education; having both a son and grandson from his first marriage to a noblewoman, he did not anticipate that a daughter born to his former maid might one day inherit the Russian throne, which had until that point never been occupied by a woman; as such, it was left to Catherine to raise the girls, a task met with considerable difficulty due to her own lack of education.

       " Document(page_content='The succession to the childless queen of England Elizabeth I was an open question from her accession in 1558 to her death in 1603, when the crown passed to James VI of Scotland, an event known as the Union of the Crowns. While the accession of James went smoothly, the succession had been the subject of much debate for decades. In some scholarly views, it was a major political factor of the entire reign, even if not so voiced. Separate aspects have acquired their own nomenclature: the \"Norfolk conspiracy\", Patrick Collinson\\'s \"Elizabethan exclusion crisis\", the \"Secret Correspondence\", and the \"Valentine Thomas affair\".\\nThe topics of debate remained obscured by uncertainty.\\nElizabeth I avoided establishing the order of succession in any form, presumably because she feared for her own life once a successor was named.  She was also concerned with England forming a productive relationship with Scotland, whose Catholic and Presbyterian strongholds were resistant to female leadership. Catholic women who would be submissive to the Pope and not to English constitutional law were rejected.\\nThe will of Elizabeth\\'s father, Henry VIII, had named one male and seven females living at his death in 1547 as the line of succession: (1) his son Edward VI, (2) Mary I, (3) Elizabeth I, (4) Jane Grey, (5) Katherine Grey, (6) Mary Grey, and (7) Margaret Clifford. By 1596, Elizabeth had outlived all others.\\nA number of authorities considered that the legal position hinged on documents such as the statute De natis ultra mare of Edward III, and the will of Henry VIII. There were different opinions about the application of these documents.

When in 1565 Margaret Douglas\\'s elder son Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, married Mary, Queen of Scots, the \"Lennox claim\" was generally regarded as consolidated into the \"Stuart claim\".\\n\\n\\n=== Stuart claimants ===\\nJames VI was the son of two grandchildren of Margaret Tudor. Arbella Stuart, the most serious other contender by the late 16th century, was the daughter of Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox\\'s younger son Charles Stuart, 1st Earl of Lennox.\\nJames VI\\'s mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, was considered a plausible successor to the English throne. At the beginning of Elizabeth\\'s reign she sent ambassadors to England when a parliament was summoned, anticipating a role for parliament in settling the succession in her favour. Mary was a Roman Catholic, and her proximity to the succession was a factor in plotting, including the Throckmorton plot and the Babington plot, making her position a political problem for the English government, eventually resolved by judicial means. She was executed in 1587. In that year, Mary\\'s son James reached the age of twenty-one, while Arbella was only twelve.\\n\\n\\n=== Suffolk claimants ===\\nWhile the Stuart line of James and Arbella would have had political support, by 1600 the descendants of Mary Tudor were theoretically relevant, and on legal grounds could not be discounted. Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk, and Eleanor Clifford, Countess of Cumberland, both had children who were in the line of succession. Frances and Eleanor were Mary Tudor\\'s daughters by her second husband, Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk.
